# Mad Reading Law Classification Using Mel Frequency Cepstal Coefficient (MFCC) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) 
This study aims to be able to classify the law of recitation of recitation, especially in the law of Mad recitation of the letter Maryam verses 1 to 15. 

[[Project]](https://github.com/virgantara/Madd-Reader) 

## Overview
This study builds a model using the Mel Frequency Ceptral Coefficient (MFCC) feature extraction with the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm method

## Installation

```
pip install python_speech_features
pip install hmmlearn
pip install scipy
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

	               time, all activities are limited. This pandemic has also greatly
	               impacted the process of teaching and evaluating the reading of
	               the Koran which was carried out using the talaqqi and musyafahah
	               methods. Machine Learning research has been developed for the
	               legal classification of Quran recitation. This study aims to be
	               able to classify the law of recitation of recitation, especially
	               in the law of Mad recitation of the letter Maryam verses 1 to
	               15. This study builds a model using the Mel Frequency Ceptral
	               Coefficient (MFCC) feature extraction with the Hidden Markov
	               Model (HMM) algorithm method. MFCC is used for feature
	               extraction in voice that processes voice data in several stages,
	               including pre-emphasis, frame-blocking, windowing, Fast Fourier
	               Transform, Mel Frequency Wrapping, and Ceptral Liftering. HMM is
	               used in speech recognition with standard sentence percentages.
	               The dataset used in this study is voice data taken from the
	               voice of the Quran reciter that has been recognized and has been
	               affiliated. The test results on the model that has been built
	               have an average percentage of 80\% accuracy of the test data.",
